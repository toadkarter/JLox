# JLox
The purpose of JLox is to create a fictional languages from the _Crafting Interpreters_ book that can be read either from a file or via interactive prompt. 
This initial draft will be written in Java - my intention is to rewrite it in C once the bones of this version are complete for optimisation purposes.
